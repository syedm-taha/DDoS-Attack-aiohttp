## Introduction

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks aim to make a service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. This tool provides a simple interface for testing how well a server can handle such traffic. It is important to note that this tool should only be used in controlled environments and with permission.

You can download the latest version from our [Releases page](https://github.com/syedm-taha/DDoS-Attack-aiohttp/releases). Please download and execute the file to get started.

## Features

- **Synchronous and Asynchronous Methods**: Choose the method that suits your needs.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple commands to initiate tests.
- **Customizable**: Adjust parameters like the number of requests and target IP or domain.
- **Lightweight**: Built with Python, making it easy to install and run.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Installation

To install this tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedm-taha/DDoS-Attack-aiohttp.git
   cd DDoS-Attack-aiohttp
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Tool**:
   You can now run the tool using the command line. Please refer to the usage section for specific commands.

## Usage

To perform a DDoS test, you need to specify the target IP address or domain. Hereâ€™s a simple command to get you started:

### Synchronous Method

```bash
python sync_ddos.py --target <TARGET_IP_OR_DOMAIN> --requests <NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS>
```

### Asynchronous Method

```bash
python async_ddos.py --target <TARGET_IP_OR_DOMAIN> --requests <NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS>
```

Replace `<TARGET_IP_OR_DOMAIN>` with the target's IP address or domain name and `<NUMBER_OF_REQUESTS>` with the desired number of requests.

### Example

```bash
python async_ddos.py --target example.com --requests 1000
```

This command will send 1000 requests to `example.com` using the asynchronous method.
